## Overview

Hosteee is an easy-to-use hotel/hostel management system.
One might think about it as a Wordpress for hostels.

We would like to supply both a simple back-end solution (such as managing reservations and payments), and a front-end that will seamlessly reflect the system.

## Code Example

TBD

## Motivation

We're enthusiastic about technology, so we decided to start a project.
We thought about this idea since one of the founders of this idea has a family camping site.

We saw how aggregation sited dictate the that business is run, and we noticed how badly a small hostel needs its own management system.
All the solutions so far are really expansive and don't fit the needs of a small establishment (overly featured and hard to manage).

We decided to create a simple website that would answer the basic needs of such establishments, enter Hosteee.
